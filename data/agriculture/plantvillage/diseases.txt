Apple Description An apple is a deciduous tree grown for its fruits, known as apples. Apple fruits are one of the most widely cultivated fruits in the world. They are round pome in shape and range in color from green to red. The domestic apple tree is believed to have originated from Western Asia and the Mediterranean, having several wild ancestors. China is the largest producer of apples worldwide. Apple farming can be profitable and rewarding for farmers with suitable land, climate, and markets. Crop Details Scientific Name Malus domestica Common Name tufaha Sw, apple tree En, manzano Sp, pommier Fr Uses Benefits Apples are most commonly eaten fresh but can also be used for baking and cooking. They can be processed into applesauce, cider, vinegar, juice, or butter. Slices can be dried for later consumption. Apples can also be used for the extraction of useful compounds such as fructose and pectin. Apples are rich in fiber, Vitamin C, minerals, and antioxidants. Apples are a great source of soluble fiber, which can help reduce intestinal disorders. They also aid in controlling insulin levels by slowly releasing sugar into the bloodstream. Additionally, apples can lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of respiratory diseases. They are also known for their ability to detoxify and cleanse the body. Furthermore, apples have been traditionally used to treat conditions such as fever, dysentery, diarrhea, and constipation. Varieties of Apple There are thousands of apple varieties available around the world, and each one has its own unique characteristics such as size, color, shape, flavor, texture, ripening time, storage life, and disease resistance. Apple varieties can be broadly classified into three categories 1 cider varieties, 2 cooking varieties, and 3 dessert varieties. These categories differ in various aspects such as color, size, aroma, smoothness, crispness, and tang. Some of the most commonly known apple varieties are Red Delicious, Golden Delicious, Gala, Fuji, Granny Smith, Honeycrisp, Braeburn, McIntosh, Jonagold, and Pink Lady. Propagation Basic Requirements Apple trees grow best in the tropics and at higher latitudes. They require a mild growing season and a cold winter to break their dormancy. In these latitudes, the tree will flower in spring and the fruit will ripen in the fall. In the tropics, the leaves will remain on the tree longer, making it essentially evergreen, and flowering and fruiting will happen sporadically throughout the year unless the tree manages to enforce a uniform cycle across the entire tree by bending shoots to create a wide tree. Apple trees require fertile, welldrained, and wellaerated loamysandy soil, with a slightly acidic to alkaline pH of 5.56.5. You must test your soil before planting and amend it with organic matter, lime, or sulfur if necessary. Apples require a lot of moisture during the flowering and fruiting stage. Therefore, if you are growing apples in hotter regions, you will need to irrigate your trees. However, keep in mind that excess water around the root zone will encourage disease outbreaks and result in low crop yield. The best method of irrigating apples is through drip irrigation. Growing from Seed When planted from a seed, an apple tree can take six to ten years to mature and produce fruit of its own. Apple trees are small to mediumsized, reaching heights of 510 m 16.432.8 ft, with a central trunk that divides into several branches. The leaves of the tree are oval in shape and can reach up to 13 cm 5.1 in in length and 7 cm 2.8 in in width. The standard method of propagating apple trees is by budding. When planting an apple nursery or orchard, it is highly advisable to plant seedlings budded from rootstock to prevent an increase in bud dormancy. Budded trees should be pruned in the first year to encourage new shoot growth. Apple trees can also be propagated by grafting and mound layering. Grafting involves joining the lower part of one plant rootstock with the upper part scion of another. Grafting is usually done during the dormant season and must be performed on dormant scion and stock wood. Mound layering is used to propagate apple clonal rootstocks. Soil is mounded around shoots that have been cut back, thereby stimulating roots to grow at the base of the shoots. A year before propagation begins, 810 mm 0.30.4 in diameter stock plants are planted in rows and then cut back to 4560 cm 17.723.6 in. They are then grown for one year. In the spring, the plants are again cut back, this time to 2.5 cm 1 in above the ground. New shoots gradually form, and more soil and bark are added in mounds around the plants. This cycle can continue throughout the growing season. Then the shoots are harvested by cutting close to the bases. The mother stool beds are then left exposed until further growth of the new shoots has occurred, and another cycle of hilling begins. Apple seedlings are planted with a depth of 1012 inches and spaced 810 feet apart in rows. General Care and Maintenance In the tropics, apple trees require careful management to make heavy crop loads sustainable. This includes bending shoots, pruning the tips, and defoliating the trees. Flowers are also removed to promote growth until the first fruit production, generally after 2 years. Harvesting An apple is ready for picking when its background skin color turns from green to yellow. The fruit comes off easily when harvested. Harvesting apples at the right time is key, not only to obtain the highest quality fruit but also to maximize the storage life. Maturation time is dependent on weather conditions during the growing season. Early maturing apples are harvested in AugustSeptember. There are several reasons why proper picking technique is important. First, simply pulling apples from the tree with force is likely to bruise the fruit and remove the stems. Apples without stems do not store as well as apples with stems. Second, it is easy to identify apples that have been picked incorrectly. They will have noticeable fingerprint bruises. Make sure to palm instead of grab when picking. Yanking tends to remove spurs from the tree. These fruit spurs represent next years crop, so by pulling them off, there will be fewer apples to harvest next year. In addition to not pulling the apples from the tree, there are some other actions that are important to avoid. Apples that have touched the ground are a potential source of contamination. Never mix apples from the ground with picked apples. Apples that are decaying or rotten should be dropped on the ground and never placed in your bin. Do not throw or drop apples into your bucket, as this will certainly cause bruising. And always avoid squeezing the fruit when picking. References CABI Crop Protection Compendium. 2013.

The plant can be erect with short stems or vinelike with long, spreading stems. The stems are covered in coarse hairs and the leaves are arranged spirally. The tomato plant produces yellow flowers, which can develop into a cyme of 312, and usually, a round fruit berry that is fleshy, smoothed skin, and can be red, pink, purple, brown, orange, or yellow in color. The tomato plant can grow 0.72 m 2.36.6 ft in height and as an annual, is harvested after only one growing season. Tomato may also be referred to as the love apple and originates from South America. Tomatoes are native to South and Central America, but they are now grown all over the world. Tomatoes are one of Africas most widely grown vegetable crops. They are grown for home consumption in almost every homesteads backyard across SubSaharan Africa. They are a good source of vitamins as well as a cash crop for smallholders and mediumscale commercial farmers. Tomatoes used as flavor enhancers in food are always in high demand, both fresh and processed. Crop Details Scientific Name Lycopersicon esculentum Common Name Nyanya Swahili Inyanya luhya Uses Benefits Tomato fruit can be eaten raw or cooked and is used in many dishes. The fruit may also be processed into juice, soup, ketchup, puree, paste or powder. Varieties Tomatoes are classified into two types based on plant habit determinate and indeterminate. Determinate and semideterminate varieties have flower clusters at the end of their stems. The determinate is shorter and bushier, whereas the semideterminate is taller. Indeterminate varieties produce new leaves and flowers all the time and can grow very tall. Indeterminate varieties bear fruit for a longer period of time. Indeterminate varieties must be staked and pruned and require more labor. a.Roma tomato variety They are also referred to as a paste tomato Paste tomatoes, like roma tomatoes, have a thicker fruit wall, fewer seeds, and a denser but grainier flesh. Roma tomatoes are oblong in shape and large for their size. They are also firmer than nonroma or paste tomatoes. They are determinate in the sense that they ripen all of sudden in place of at some stage in the season. While they can be consumed raw, they are at their best when cooked. b. Anna F1 tomato variety These varieties produce very high yields, require less labor, and are relatively resistant to tomato diseases. Its a fresh market tomato variety that grows best in a greenhouse. Its an ovalshaped, deepred fruits. It is one of Kenyas tomato varieties resistant to Alternaria stem canker, nematodes, and Fusarium wilt. This variety matures quickly, relatively seventyfive days after transplanting. Its maturity period is determined by the weather. The first harvest of Anna F1 yields less than later harvests, as with most tomato varieties in Kenya. Anna F1 produces an average of 74 tons of tomatoes per acre and 35 kg per tomato plant. c. Bingo Bingo is a largefruited Heirloom Tomato Seed is widely adapted to a wide range of growing conditions and consistently produces large, smooth fruit. To protect the fruit from sunburn, the plant grows a dense canopy of leaves. d. Plum A plum tomato, also known as a processing tomato or paste tomato, is a tomato variety bred for sauce and packing. They are typically oval or cylindrical in shape, with fewer locules than standard round tomatoes and a higher solid content, making them more suitable for processing. e. Cherry tomato The cherry tomato is a small round tomato that comes in red, yellow, green, and black colors. Since theyre naturally sweet, they are typically eaten raw in salads. Propagation Basic Requirements For high yield and premium quality, tomatoes prefer a relatively cool, dry climate. It is, however, adaptable to a wide range of climatic conditions. Tomatoes have been grown as far north under protection as the Arctic Circle and as far south as the hot and humid equator. Temperatures between 21 and 24C are ideal for growth and development. Prolonged exposure to temperatures below 12C can result in chilling. Temperatures above 27C have a negative impact on growth and fruit set. Pollen and egg cells are destroyed when the maximum daytime temperature is 38C or higher for 5 to 10 days. Fruit set is also generally poor when night temperatures exceed 21C just before and after flower formation. Flower abortion can also be caused by hot, dry winds. Tomatoes are not affected by day length and can produce fruit in photoperiods ranging from 7 to 19 hours. Tomatoes can be grown in a variety of soil types, from sandy loam to clayloam soils rich in organic matter. The ideal pH range for soil is 6 to 6.5 higher or lower pH can result in mineral deficiencies or toxicities. Flooding for extended periods is harmful to tomato growth and development. Growing from Seed Tomatoes can be directseeded or transplanted in the field, but this method is costly because large amounts of seed are required about 500 to 1000 g of seedsha and four weeks of weeding labor is added to the growing costs. Growing young transplants in a special nursery, on the other hand, allows growers to achieve high seedling uniformity while using less seed and saving money on weeding. Nursery bed preparation General Care and Maintenance Tomatoes respond well to liberal applications of wellrotted compost or manure. A spoonful or three teaspoons of rock phosphate should also be added to each planting hole. If the soil is deficient in organic matter, it is best to grow a crop of highquality green manure like cowpeas, mucuna, soybeans, or crotalaria before transplanting tomato seedlings. Avoid commercial nitrogen fertilizers because too much nitrogen causes fruit puffiness and blossomend rot, as well as excessive vegetative growth. Excess free nitrogen in the soil softens the leaves and makes the plants more appealing to pests and diseases. Weed competition can be fierce, especially in the hot and humid tropics. Slash emerging weeds as close to the ground as possible between rows of tomatoes to control weeds on open land crops. Leave slashed weeds as mulch on the soil to help prevent erosion, lower soil temperature, and conserve soil moisture. This should be supplemented by manual weeding in rows and straw mulching of the beds. For tall growing indeterminate varieties, firmly plant a 2 m stake in the ground for each tomato plant and loosely tie the stems as the plant grows. Alternatively, place a sturdy pole in the ground every four meters and run two wires one at 2 meters and another at 0.15 meters above the ground. Connect the two wires behind each tomato plant with a fairly strong string. As the plants grow, they can be carefully twisted around the strings. For indeterminate tomato varieties, pruning is required. On a weekly basis, one or two main stems should be allowed to grow and the side branches laterals should be pinched off as the crop grows. When 6 to 8 flower clusters form, the growing top should be pinched off to promote the development of large marketable fruit. Remove any leaves that are close to the ground to help prevent blight infection. On determinate cultivars, there is no pruning and no regulation of fruit number and clusters. Semideterminate cultivars can be grown as both a determinate and an indeterminate crop. To avoid spreading tobacco mosaic virus disease, smokers should thoroughly wash their hands with soap before handling tomato plants. Tomatoes require adequate irrigation during the early stages of plant growth, fruit set, and fruit enlargement. The consistency of water supply to the plants is critical in achieving uniform maturity. It also reduces the occurrence of blossomend rot, a physiological disorder caused by a lack of calcium during fruit enlargement. Watering is required at least twice a week in dry weather. Because it does not cause water splashes on the plants, drip irrigation is the most efficient and riskfree method of irrigation. Although indeterminate, cherry tomatoes can produce quite well even when not staked in the field, but they must be given adequate space because they spread quite widely one m2 per plant is recommended. Higher output and easier field management are advantages of the costly staking procedure. Harvesting Before being marketed, freshmarket tomatoes are frequently harvested at the maturegreen stage and ripened in transit or storage. Ethylene is sometimes used to quickly and uniformly ripen maturegreen tomatoes before shipping them to market, but this has a negative impact on quality. In Kenya, this is not a common practice. Preripe tomatoes are generally of lower quality lower soluble solids, ascorbic acid, and reducing sugars than plantripened tomatoes. Freshmarket tomato cultivars growth and ripening patterns necessitate frequent pickings for either maturegreen or plantripe fruits. Processing tomatoes, as opposed to fresh market or table tomatoes, are picked fully ripe. Harvesting is often done by machine in developed countries. Tomatoes used in pureed products such as soup, juice, and sauces are grown until more than 85 of the fruits are ripe. Those for whole tomatoes are picked while still firm, but only about 65 of the crop may be ready at once. To prepare tomatoes for market, store them in a shady location, either in the field or at home, after picking. The marketable fruits are then packaged in appropriate containers, which are typically 20kg wooden boxes, bamboo baskets, plastic boxes, or other locally available packaging materials. Proper packaging protects the fruits and reduces water loss. Tomato storage life is determined by the maturity stage at which they are harvested as well as the desired fruit quality. Quality is highest when fully ripe, whether artificially or naturally. To ripen properly, maturegreen tomatoes should be stored for 7 to 10 days at 13 to 18C and 85 to 90 RH. The single most important visual parameter of tomato quality is color. Lycopene development is generally poor at temperatures above 30C. This is the primary reason that tomatoes grown in the hot tropics have a pale red or yellowish color and are bland in flavor. Cherry tomato harvesting and packaging are determined by market demand. Fruit clusters can be cut for distant markets when the fruits turn red or pink, depending on the cultivar. For the domestic market, firm red ripe fruits are required. However, cherry tomatoes for the export market are graded and packaged into prepacks before being shipped directly to supermarkets in the export destinations. A marketable yield of 20 tonsha or higher is considered a good yield. Under experimental conditions at KALRO, Thika Horticultural Research Station, yields of up to 60 tonsha have been obtained. When harvesting tomatoes for seed, pick ripe fruit from only robust, diseasefree plants plants free of bacterial canker, bacterial speck, bacterial spot, anthracnose fruit rot, early blight, late blight, and tomato mosaic virus. Wash the fruit, preferably with a potassiumbased soap, to reduce the risk of disease infection. Cut the fruit in half and scoop out the seeds with a spoon. Alternatively, squeeze the pieces into a clean bucket, plastic, glass, or ceramic bowl until only the seedjelly and fruit sap remain. Cover the bowl with a cloth or paper to keep dirt and other contaminants out, but dont make it airtight. Allow the seeds to sit for 1 to 5 days usually 2 to 3 days in warm areas. If seeds cannot be sown right away, they should be stored in a waterproof container transparent plastic bag clear glass bottle. Transparent materials allow sunlight in, reducing mould growth. Put some ashes in the bottom of the container to absorb moisture and keep the seeds from moulding. When storing seeds in pots or bottles, the tops should be covered with plastic film to prevent water seepage and mite infestation. Keep the seed container in a cool, dry location. Check the seeds for mould development on a regular at least weekly basis. If mould is found, the seeds should be dried again. Seeds can be stored for up to two years if properly dried. One kg of tomatoes produces between 1 and 4 grams of seeds.

Potato Description The potato Solanum tuberosum is a widely cultivated root vegetable in the Solanaceae family. They are native to the Andes Mountains in South America and have been grown for thousands of years. Potatoes are a staple food in many countries around the world and are used in a wide variety of dishes. They are high in carbohydrates, fiber, and vitamins C and B6. Potatoes are typically planted in the spring and harvested in the late summer or early fall. They grow best in welldrained soils with a pH between 4.5 and 7.5. Potatoes require a lot of water, especially during the flowering and fruiting stages, and they are sensitive to frost. The crop can be propagated from seed potatoes, which are small tubers that are planted in the soil. They can also be propagated from potato seed, which is a less common method. Once the seed potato or seed is planted, the plant will grow leaves and flowers, and then it will produce tubers underground. The potato is a herbaceous perennial plant grown for its edible tubers. The plant has a branched stem and leaves consisting of leaflets that are both unequal in size and shape and can be oval to oblong in shape. The leaves can reach up to 1030 cm in length. Tubers grow about 25 cm underground in the soil and can be yellow, red, or purple depending on the variety. The potato plant produces white or blue flowers and yellowgreen berries. The plants can go up to 1m 3.3ft in height. Potatoes are grown in many countries across Africa, but the main potatoproducing countries are Egypt, South Africa, Ethiopia, and Kenya. In these countries, potatoes are grown both for local consumption and for export. Potatoes are a relatively new crop in Africa, having been introduced to the continent in the late 19th century. However, since then, potato production has increased significantly, with farmers in Africa recognizing the potential of the crop as a food security and income generation opportunity. Potatoes grow well in the cool highland regions of Africa, where the temperature and rainfall are suitable for the crop. However, potato cultivation in Africa is often challenged by a lack of access to quality seed potatoes, a lack of irrigation systems, and the prevalence of pests and diseases. FAOSTAT reports that production of potatoes in Africa has more than doubled, with eastern Africa producing the biggest yield. The crop is primarily produced by smallholder farmers, with Algeria leading in production with 4,928,028 tons per year, overtaking Egypt, which produces 4,800,000 tons per year. The following is a summary of the physical attributes of potato crops Crop Details Uses Benefits Potato tubers are a staple food source in temperate regions and are eaten after cooking. They may be cut or sliced and made into potato chips or fries. Potatoes can also be processed into starch, alcohol or flour. Potatoes are a good source of carbohydrates, potassium, and vitamin C they are also a source of fiber, vitamin B6, and folate. They are low in fat, calories, and sodium. The values shown in the following table are approximate and may vary depending on the variety, growing conditions, and preparation method of the potatoes. Additionally, cooking and processing methods such as frying or mashing can change the nutritional value of potatoes and increase their calorie and fat content. Varieties Potatoes are grown in many countries across Africa, and different varieties are grown depending on the region and the local market. For example, in Egypt, the most common variety grown is Desiree, which is a redskinned variety with a waxy texture that is good for boiling and mashing. In South Africa, farmers grow varieties such as Bintje, Sifra, and Agria, which are known for their high yields and good storage capabilities. In Ethiopia, farmers grow varieties such as Sarpo Mira, which is known for its resistance to pests and diseases, and Shepody, which is known for its good taste and texture. In Kenya, farmers grow varieties such as Kenya Mpya, Shangi, and Kenya Raha, which are known for their high yields and good taste. Its worth noting that Africa has a rich diversity of local varieties of potatoes known as landraces. These varieties have been developed and adapted to the local conditions and have the potential to provide food security and income for the farmers. However, the use of improved varieties and the adoption of good agricultural practices are necessary to achieve the full potential of potato production in Africa. Propagation Basic Requirements Potatoes are a coolseason crop that grows best in certain climatic, soil, and water conditions. Potatoes prefer a cool climate with moderate temperatures and a long growing season. They grow best at temperatures between 1015 C 5059 F during the day and 510 C 4150 F during the night. Potatoes are sensitive to frost, and temperatures below 0C 32F can damage the tubers. Potatoes also require a moderatetohigh amount of rainfall or irrigation. They grow best in welldrained soils that are rich in organic matter and have a pH between 4.5 and 7.5. They prefer soils that are high in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium and also require adequate levels of calcium, magnesium, and sulfur. Potatoes also grow well in sandy loam or clay soils. Potatoes require a lot of water, especially during the flowering and fruiting stages. They need about 12 inches of water per week, and more in hot and dry weather. They prefer consistent moisture throughout the growing season but also require good drainage to prevent waterlogging and root rot. Potatoes are sensitive to drought and water stress, which can cause reduced yields and lowerquality tubers. Its worth noting that while these are the ideal conditions for growing potatoes, the crop can be grown in a wide range of conditions, and some varieties are more tolerant to different conditions than others. Additionally, agronomic practices such as fertilization, irrigation, and crop rotation can help to improve the growth and yields of potatoes in challenging environments. Growing from Seed The planting procedure for potatoes generally includes the following steps Preparing the soil The soil should be welldrained and have a pH between 4.57.5. Prior to planting, the soil should be worked to a fine tilth, and any necessary amendments such as fertilizer or lime should be added. Choosing seed potatoes Seed potatoes should be diseasefree and certified. They should be cut into pieces with at least one eye per piece, and should be left to dry for a few days before planting to allow the cuts to heal over. Determining the planting date The best time to plant potatoes will depend on your climate and the variety you are growing. Potatoes are typically planted in the spring, after the last frost date, and when the soil has warmed up to around 1015C 5059F. Planting the seed potatoes Seed potatoes should be planted at a depth of around 1015 cm, with the eyes facing upward. They should be spaced around 3040 cm apart, in rows that are 7590 cm apart. Watering and mulching After planting, the soil should be watered well to settle the soil around the seed potatoes and to encourage germination. A layer of mulch, such as straw or grass clippings, can be applied to help retain moisture and suppress weeds. General Care and Maintenance As the plants grow, they will require regular watering, fertilization, and weeding. The plants should be hilled up soil should be added to the base of the plant as they grow to prevent the tubers from being exposed to sunlight, which can cause them to turn green and become inedible. Harvesting Harvesting potatoes is the process of collecting the tubers, which are the edible part of the potato plant, from the soil. The timing of the harvest is crucial and will depend on the variety of potato being grown. Generally, potatoes are ready to be harvested when the foliage has died back and the skin of the tubers has hardened. Before harvesting, farmers need to check the tubers for maturity. This can be done by gently digging up a few plants and checking the size and skin of the tubers. The tubers should be fully formed, and the skin should be tough enough that it cant be easily scraped off with your fingernail. When it comes to the actual harvesting process, farmers should be careful not to damage the tubers. They should be carefully dug up using a spade or potato fork, taking care not to damage the tubers. Its better to harvest when the soil is dry and not wet. After harvesting, the tubers should be placed in a warm, dark, and wellventilated place for a week or two to cure harden the skin before being stored. After curing, the tubers should be cleaned of any dirt and debris, and any damaged or diseased tubers should be removed and discarded. Potatoes should be stored in a cool, dark, and wellventilated place with a temperature between 4 and 8 C 39 and 46 F and a relative humidity of 90 to 95 . Its important to harvest potatoes at the right time to ensure the best quality and storage potential. Overripe potatoes have a higher chance of spoilage and cant be stored as long as mature ones. Additionally, its also important to properly cure, clean, and store the tubers to ensure they maintain their freshness and quality for as long as possible.
